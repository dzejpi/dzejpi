- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dzejpi, I work as QA, but I am making simple videogames in my free time.
- ðŸ›  Some of my older projects were made with Game Maker, but I am exclusively using Godot now. 
  - When it comes to visual tools, I use Aseprite for pixel graphics, Krita instead of photoshop and Inkscape for vector graphics. 
  - When it comes making music, I attempted to use FL Studio, because it gives you more features for significantly less money, but I just couldn't get used to it, so you will mostly see Ableton projects in case there is any music. When it comes to VSTs, then I use Sylent1 and Kairatune VSTs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently still learning Godot and proper 3D in Blender and Crocotile 3D.
