- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dzejpi, I work as QA, but I am trying to code simple videogames in my free time.
- ğŸ›  Most of my projects here will be made with Game Maker, Aseprite, Inkscape and FL Studio (using Sylent1 and Kairatune VSTs).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity 3D and proper 3D in Blender.
- ğŸ“« The best way how to reach me at this time would be directly here. Cheers!
